# Design System: 19-nextjs-ecommerce-starter

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Luxury Tech / High-End Atelier** aesthetic. It uses a clean ceramic white foundation accented by "Zenith Gold" (#d4af37) and deep slate, focusing on spaciousness, premium typography, and grain-textured depth.

## Design Patterns
-   **Zenith Radii**: Full-circle rounding for floating badges and navigation elements to offset the sharp structural slate lines.
-   **Textured Depth**: Grainy noise overlays (10-20% opacity) to simulate high-end tactile surfaces.
-   **Luxury Cards**: Spacious aspect-ratio containers (4/5) with translate-up hover triggers for "Quick Add" actions.
-   **Glow Orchestration**: Blur-heavy (120px) gold aura elements to create specialized focus areas for brand storytelling.

## Color Palette
-   **Atelier White**: Ceramic Foundation (#ffffff)
-   **Structural Core**: Slate-900 (#0f172a)
-   **Zenith Gold**: Luxury Accent (#d4af37)
-   **Muted Precision**: Slate-500 (#64748b)

## Interaction Design
-   **Luxury Entrance**: Slow, 0.8s - 1.0s motion reveals to simulate a "Curated Opening" experience.
-   **Vault Transitions**: Scale-and-rotate physics (12 to 0 degrees) for featured assets during scroll.
-   **Tactile Feedback**: 95% scaling on premium buttons with shadow-offset compression.
